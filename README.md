                         Context

  Irrespective of whether or not data and images are stored/analyzed in a centralized manner, variability in scanner models, acquisition protocols and reconstruction 
settings are unavoidable in the current clinical practice. Yet radiomics are notoriously sensitive to such protocol variations. Hence, there is a clear need for the harmonization 
of features in order to allow consistent findings in radiomics multicenter studies.

                        Objective 
                        
  The objective of this project is to develop different models to predict failure (endpoint) of the radiomics signature based from MRI, PET and CT scans. 

                         Dataset
                         
radiomics.csv contains 197 rows and 498 columns: 
Failure.binary: binary property to predict
